The vendor app was created exclusively with [QtQuick / QML](http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-4.8/qtquick.html) with some Javascript helping along.  To get started using it you must download and install [the Qt SDK](http://qt.nokia.com/products/qt-sdk/) by Nokia.  Please review below for additional detail.

  * [Download the program](http://cs422projectx.googlecode.com/files/People.zip) (approx. 3 MB, ZIP file)
  * [Installation instructions](http://code.google.com/p/cs422projectx/wiki/install)
  * [Design notes](http://code.google.com/p/cs422projectx/wiki/report)


Please direct any questions or issues regarding the application directly to me.  You may email directly at dyoung24 **omit the bold** @uic.edu
